In Algorithms and Data Structures I, we were introduced to the fundamentals of algorithms, focusing on concepts like recursion, as well as search (linear, binary) and sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quicksort). The course also introduced key data structures, including stacks, queues, and binary trees. These structures were analyzed for their efficiency in organizing and processing data.
